## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - I am making no assumptions.
- Assets:
  - The assets that are important to protect are the elements of the stadium, such as the lights, the seats, the field, and the equipment of the teams that utilize this stadium. Lights are needed for a night game, so that the players can see the field for play and for safety. It's important that the seats are protected so that viewers can comfortably sit and watch the game. It's important that the field itself is protected so that players are safe on the field when they are playing. You need to make sure the team equipment is not modified such that it is not up to the standards the equipment usually is, and you want to make sure that no one can vandalize it.
- Threats:
  - The security threats that I will choose to protect against are stupid college students, malicious people that support other football teams, and some natural occuring events. First, we need to make sure that the light controls are locked with some high end security. You don't want college students messing with the lights and using up that electricity. You want to make sure that the lights themselves are physically protected so people can't throw things at them and break the lights. This would mean no lights, and glass on the field. You also want to make sure that the seats are bolted to the ground, because you don't want people stealing setas. You also need to make sure the rooms for the equipment are locked so people don't steal or vandalize them. All the previous stuff also applies to malicious people of the other football team. Now, you could also invest in a tarp or something of that sort to protect the field from rains and other weather events that could ruin the integrity of the grass/astroturf.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {TSA}
- Assumptions:
  - I am making no assumptions.
- Assets:
  - The assets that you need to protect are the building (and all facilities inside it), the people currently inside the building and the people that will be arriving from arriving flights, and the planes that people will be getting on. You need to make sure that people aren't bringing in items that can get by locked doors that could give them access to various elements of the building, like doors, lights, or security cameras. You need to make sure that you protect the people that are in line that are waiting to go through security. You also need to make sure that the people that are arriving from other countries are safe.
- Threats:
  - There are various things that can be used in nefarious ways to get into buildings and hurt people currently in, or arriving into, the building.
- Countermeasures:
  - Some countermeasures that can be taken are some things that the TSA already implements. They have an X-ray machine to scan bags and metal detectors for people.
