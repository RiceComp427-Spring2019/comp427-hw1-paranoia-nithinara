## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that I have the ability to lock up certain elements of the stadium and that I also have access to certain things like the light box and the equipment room.
- Assets:
  - The stadium lights are an asset. Lights are needed for a night game, so that the players can see the field for play and for safety. If the lights are defective, then games cannot be played or players could get hurt without adequate sight. Also, if the lights are somehow broken or tampered with, glass shards could be on the field which could injure players.
  - The stadium seats are an asset. People need seats to watch the game. Although this may not be a problem at Rice due to lack of audience turnout, at a university whose team is frequently ranked among the best in the country, it's important to have people be comfortably seated. Without proper seats, audience turnout could decrease, and people could get hurt while standing to watch if there's enough of a crowd. If seats are tampered with, people could hurt themselves when they sit down if the integrity of the seat is compromised.
  - The stadium field is an asset. In order to play football, a proper and well kept field is required. I don't play football, but I know that there are yard lines. We need to make sure that these are not vandalized or tampered with, because this could affect a player's ability to perform a play, and commentators'/referees' abilities to discern what is happening on the field. We also want to make sure the integrity of the field is protected so that players don't injure themslelves if the field is muddy.
  - The team equipment is an asset. It's important that our team players are properly protected when playing football. I assume that the equipment and locker rooms are housed underneath the stadium. If the equipment is tampered with, players can get hurt during the game if the integrity of the equiepment is not up to standard. It's also possible that if the equipment is stolen, then players simply cannot suit up to play the game.
  - The people that are in the stadium during practices and plays are important to protect. We want to make sure that when there is a significant number of people that the stadiums are not open to the public, or require some sort of screening process to prevent adverseries that want to hurt people from entering a densely populated area.
- Threats:
  - Stupid college students are a threat. Being that this is a university stadium, there will be kids that get drunk and want to sneak into the stadium. There might be kids that are dared to vandalize or break property in the stadium. These kinds of threats can be stopped with countermeasrues that I will describe later.
  - Malicious people that want our football team to lose could attempt to hurt the assets provided. These are people that are activily wanting to, or are paid to, vandalize and ruin property of the stadium. They are not as "innocent" as drunk college kids or kids being dared to do something, as they have the intent to break things in order to make it harder for the team to play, in the hopes that our team will lose or players will get hurt and cannot play.
  - Naturally occurring weather events could destroy the stadium. Strong winds could blow things around the stadium and break things. Lots of rain could ruin the field, or make it unsafe to play. There could be lightening and thunder that could affect the field, and it might even be possible that tornado could touch down in the stadium (I think).
- Countermeasures:
  - To protect the lights, we could add some sort of physical strong plexiglass, or some material that when broken wouldn't be as unsafe as glass, but is also strong enough to protect the actual lights, while making sure the lights still work properly so people can see. This prevents people from breaking glass and making the lights not work and from people getting hurt. Putting plexiglass doens't seem too expensive in my opinion. Also, having a lock on the light/control box would easily and cheaply prevent people from messing with the lights during non play time.
  - To protect the seats, we could bolt them to the concrete, so that people can't steal them. This would prevent them from loosening them and having people get hurt, or just taking them altogether and removing comfortable seating from the stadium. I don't think this would require too much money, and this is a one time cost during construction, but if it wasn't constructed this way, it's a one time cost to do this.
  - The field itself is harder to protect, but I think a good way to protect it is having some sort of automatic tarp that can cover the top of the football stadium when it is not being used. So at night, the tarp would activate and cover the top of the stadium so things like rain don't affect it. In terms of vandalizing it, locking the entrances so that people can't get onto the field when the shouldn't seems cheap. The tarp could be quite expensive, so it may not be in the budget, but locking the entrances with a lock seems like something that would exist for the stadium already, or be quite cheap to implement. I think a tarp would be more justified in areas where there are lots of weather events like heavy rains and storms. I don't think it would make sense in an area with nice weather, like LA.
  - Team equipment seems quite easy to protect by just locking up the equipment room when people don't need to be in it. Basically, keep it unlocked when players are getting ready for scrimmage and games, and when they are out on the field, lock up the equipment room until they are done. So, the players are in the room and can be on the lookout when they need it, and it's locked, and people shouldn't be able to get in when the players are not in it.
  - In order to protect against people that want to harm a densely populated area, I would have people be screened at every stadium entrance during very big/popular games. This would be the usual metal detector and bag check to make sure no one is bringing a weapon of mass destruction in. This would be pretty cheap because you could hire people looking to make some quick bucks during games, and I'm sure you could also find people willing to volunteer their time to do it.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: TSA
- Assumptions:
  - I am making the assumptions that I have the budget to implement reasonable countermeasures, that my workers don't call in sick because we're on a government shutdown that affects our livelihood.
- Assets:
  - The assets that you need to protect are the building (and all facilities inside it), the people currently inside the building and the people that will be arriving from arriving flights, and the planes that people will be getting on. You need to make sure that people aren't bringing in items that can get by locked doors that could give them access to various elements of the building, like doors, lights, or security cameras. You need to make sure that you protect the people that are in line that are waiting to go through security. You also need to make sure that the people that are arriving from other countries are safe. You need to make sure that when people's items are being scanned that they are safe. This is why TSA already has notices for people having film that shouldn't go into X ray scanners and things of that nature. You want to make sure your screening process does not hurt the people or items going through it.
- Threats:
  - There are various things that can be used in nefarious ways to get into buildings and hurt people currently in, or arriving into, the building. You can have terrorists entering the airport with bombs.
- Countermeasures:
  - Some countermeasures that can be taken are some things that the TSA already implements. They have an X-ray machine to scan bags and metal detectors for people. These are justifiable in terms of costs 

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Rice Coffeehouse
- Explanation of choice: You are the manager of Rice Coffeehouse and make sure you can serve all your customers.
- Assumptions:
  - I don't actually work at coffeehouse, but I'm going to assume the general manager has unilateral control over certain aspects of Coffeehouse that other workers don't.
- Assets:
  - You have to make sure you protect all the food and coffee items and ingredients that are used on a daily basis. You also need to protect equipment to make sure that the coffee can be successfully made.
- Threats:
  - There are people that love coffee a lot and might be willing to steal it.
- Countermeasures:
  - We should lock up everything important, and make sure to lock down the area when there is no one on shift.
